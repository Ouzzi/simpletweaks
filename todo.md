## TODO:

- copper pressureplate - activates only when player stands longer on it, more oxidized the plate is, longer time is needed to activate it 
- copper pressureplate can bbe turned into chunk loader plate, no uprades

- netherite pressureplate - activates only when player with specific item stands on it (configurable with barrel below it), multiple items possible (like a whitelist)
- flypad - like elytrapad, same tiers, and radius, allows creative flight inside radius
- also highlight players who creative fly inside flypad radius (spectral arrow effect)
- smithable first tier with netherite upgrade and netherite and tier 4 elytra pad in smithing table
- second tier netherite upgrade + netherite block + fly pad -> tier 2 flypad (reinforced flypad)
- third tier crafting table -> netherite block + netherstar + flypad tier 2 + 2 oninous keys + 4 diablocks -> tier 3 flypad (netherite flypad)
- fourth tier crafting table -> 1 netherstar + 3 flypad tier 3  + 5 oninous keys -> tier 4 flypad (stellar flypad)

- claim deed - not protecting land, just showing who owns it

- more compostable items
- more waxing options - waxed sand and gravel to prevent falling, waxed ice to prevent melting, waxed concrete powder to prevent turning to concrete, waxesd coral blocks to prevent drying out
- dispenser place more blocks

- challenges/progressing system:
- - you get a book at first join with Introduction and list of challenges like achievements.
- - when completing challenges you get rewards like items, blocks, xp, money, perks (like faster mining, higher jumps, extra inv, ...)
- - rewards could be given via commands to be compatible with other mods
- - rewards must be collected manually via a gui (like advancements)
- - only big challenges give rewards, small ones are just for fun
- - fully customizable via config file - enable/disable challenges, custom challenges, custom rewards, ...

- 4 extra inv for challenges
- - example eat a dark heart -> wildcard slot
- - example eat a enchanted golden apple -> food slot
- - example break 10000 ores -> tool slot
- - example kill 10000 mobs -> weapon slot
