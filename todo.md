## BUGS:
- flypad:
- - spawn elytra and others are not checkted when touching ground/not flying (elytra flight end) - can be abused
- - - only when fliing it is checked uppon landing. 
- give the ammount of boost "charges" but only 3x3 above the flypad inside the area
- allow falldamage and kinetic damage when using the flypad elytra - but continue disabling it when in spawn area or using the spawnarea elytra even when flying above flypad area

- Spawn teleporter:
- - add riser sound when teleport process is on going
- - add little effects after teleporting: particles (soul, ender,... ), nausea effect (1 sec), darkness effect (3 sec), slight levitation (1 sec), slow falling (2 sec)
- - teleport 2 blocks above spawn for slow falling effect after teleporting
- - 2nd  and 3rd and 4th tier spawn teleporter - each same as first but other location (spawn 1, spawn 2, spawn 3, spawn 4)
- - - if spawn point not set, use world spawn
- - - diffrent spawn points can be set via commands by ops (/simpletweaks worldspawn setspawn1, setspawn2, setspawn3, setspawn4) (only for spawnteleporter)
- - - each tier craftable with previous tier + netherite upgrade + netherite ingot in smithing table


- later:
- claim deed - not protecting land, just showing who owns it

- unbreaking dosent work on echo compass for now

## TODO:



- copper pressureplate - activates only when player stands longer on it, more oxidized the plate is, longer time is needed to activate it 
- copper pressureplate can bbe turned into chunk loader plate, no uprades

- wooden pressureplate can be turned into ?


- more compostable items
- more waxing options - waxed sand and gravel to prevent falling, waxed ice to prevent melting, waxed concrete powder to prevent turning to concrete, waxesd coral blocks to prevent drying out
- dispenser place more blocks
- (later) realworld Transformation:
    - - two shulker shells on chest
    - - moss on cobble
    - - ...

- Chat Calc (Later)

- modmenu pages
- toggle all on some groups
 
- (Later) simplequestbook
- challenges/progressing system:
- - you get a book at first join with Introduction and list of challenges like achievements.
- - when completing challenges you get rewards like items, blocks, xp, money, perks (like faster mining, higher jumps, extra inv, ...)
- - rewards could be given via commands to be compatible with other mods
- - rewards must be collected manually via a gui (like advancements)
- - only big challenges give rewards, small ones are just for fun
- - fully customizable via config file - enable/disable challenges, custom challenges, custom rewards, ...

- 4 extra inv for challenges
- - example eat a dark heart -> wildcard slot
- - example eat a enchanted golden apple -> food slot
- - example break 10000 ores -> tool slot
- - example kill 10000 mobs -> weapon slot

## DONE:

- add effect to evey player who wears the starter elytra - highlight player like spectral arrow
- add regeneration effect when standing on spawn area
- add particles when standing on spawn teleporter

- elytra pad ( one on first join )
- - diffrent tiers - 5x5x15 radius - 15x15x31 radius - 31x31x63 radius - 63x63x127 radius
- - starter elytra equiped inside of the radius
- - craftable with any template + diamond + diamond pressure-plate (fine pressure-plate - activates only when player stands on it)
- spawnteleporter - shouldnt be broken with water/lava


- netherite pressureplate - activates only when player with specific item stands on it (configurable with barrel below it), multiple items possible (like a whitelist)
- flypad - like elytrapad, same tiers, and radius, allows creative flight inside radius
- also highlight players who creative fly inside flypad radius (spectral arrow effect)
- smithable first tier with netherite upgrade and netherite and tier 4 elytra pad in smithing table
- second tier netherite upgrade + netherite block + fly pad -> tier 2 flypad (reinforced flypad)
- third tier crafting table -> netherite block + netherstar + flypad tier 2 + 2 oninous keys + 4 diablocks -> tier 3 flypad (netherite flypad)
- fourth tier crafting table -> 1 netherstar + 3 flypad tier 3  + 5 oninous keys -> tier 4 flypad (stellar flypad)
