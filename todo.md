- challenges/progressing system:
- - you get a book at first join with Introduction and list of challenges like achievements.
- - when completing challenges you get rewards like items, blocks, xp, money, perks (like faster mining, higher jumps, extra inv, ...)
- - rewards could be given via commands to be compatible with other mods
- - rewards must be collected manually via a gui (like advancements)
- - only big challenges give rewards, small ones are just for fun
- - fully customizable via config file - enable/disable challenges, custom challenges, custom rewards, ...

- 4 extra inv for challenges
